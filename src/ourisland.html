                <h3>
                    I only speak my native language, will it be difficult to travel here because of that?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Many younger Tanitians speak fluent English, however in rural areas and especially with older residents, English is not as well known. In case of emergencies, there are many multilingual employees at the hospital and clinics.
